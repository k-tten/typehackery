want to learn how to do some of this black magic?
i will be writing a small tutorial that will hopefully teach you some of the tricks and thought process involved.
the type system is powerful and shouldn't be gatekept!

please note that i will assume you already have a basic understanding of typescript and how it works.
if you do not understand any of the following topics or ideas, the book will not be for you.

-   Duck/Structural Typing
-   Nominal Typing
-   Covariance/Contravariance/Invariance/Bivariance
-   Supertype/Subtype/Superset/Subset
-   Homomorphism
-   Finite State Machines
-   Functional Programming
-   Soundness
