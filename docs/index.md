Welcome! TypeScript's type system is extremely powerful, even Turing Complete.
It's a shame that only so few members of the community use TypeScript to its fullest potential.
My mission is to make the knowledge of the type system easily accessible.

I should preface this with the assumption that you already know a good bit.
You should have a basic understanding of the following ideas:

-   [Duck/Structural Typing][duck]
-   [Nominal Typing][nominal]
-   [Covariance/Contravariance][variance]/[Invariance][invariance]/Bivariance
-   [Supertype/Subtype][types]/[Superset/Subset][sets]
-   [Homomorphism][homo]
-   [Finite State Machines][fsm]
-   [Functional Programming][fp]

If you don't understand some of them, a quick Google will do just fine.
I will do my best to explain them in due time.

The book will attempt to explain the most useful and common aspects first.
In other words, the deeper you go, the more niche and useless the information is!

Disclaimer: I don't claim to be one of the best at using the type system.
I myself think that I am on the lower rungs of the ladder.
I'm simply just putting information out there for those who want to go deeper, but don't know how to start.
